# modelling-solar-system
This project was designed and created solely to meet the requirments of the final assessment in the *Fundamentals of Computing* module of Sheffield-Hallam University's online *MSc Computer Science*.

### Data sources

Planetary data was compiled and formatted as JSON using Google Gemin Pro 2.5 from the following sources:
* _International Astronomical Union (IAU)_: The IAU is the internationally recognized authority for naming and classifying celestial objects. https://www.iau.org/
* _NASA Science - Solar System Exploration_: Provides comprehensive, up-to-date information on planets, moons, and other objects in our solar system. https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/
* _Minor Planet Center_: Maintains a catalog of all minor bodies in the solar system, including provisional designations for newly discovered moons. https://minorplanetcenter.net/
* _JPL Solar System Dynamics_: Offers detailed orbital data and physical characteristics for celestial bodies, which is a key source for moon counts and classifications. https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/

Note that planetary such as the number of provisional  planets changes over time as new discoveries are made and verified. 


## Project specifications (as provided by SHU)
Create a program that displays information about planets in our solar system. For each planet your program should hold its: 
* Name
* Mass
* Distance from the Sun
* A list of the planet’s moons (be sensible, don’t include all of the moons for the large planets)

All data should be held using appropriate data types. Use Wikipedia to help with values

A user should be able to query your data by asking questions such as: 
* Tell me everything about Saturn? 
* How massive is Neptune? 
* Is Pluto in the list of planets? 
* How many moons does Earth have? 

You **must write a test plan that covers key parts of your solution**. You should include this as a separate file within your solution. 

You should bring all of your programming knowledge to bear on this task. 

You **must use classes throughout your program**. 

You should include code to properly validate inputs from the user. 

The raw data may be held in a file. 

You may build a simple menu system. 

You might create a GUI using Tkinter. 

You may want to use a unit testing framework to implement some, or all, of your test plan. 

Notes: 
* You must the Python Programming language. 
* **Do not** make a Web-based solution. 
* **Do not** use a relational database. 
* You will use sources such as StackOverflow discussions in building your solution. **Include references to these in comments** in your code.
