# modelling-solar-system

This project was designed and created solely to meet the requirments of the final assessment in the *Fundamentals of Computing* module of Sheffield-Hallam University's online *MSc Computer Science*.

### Data sources

Planetary data was drawn from several sources, compiled and formatted as JSON with the assistance of Google Gemini Pro 2.5. A portion of the data in solar_system_data.json was manually audited to minimze the possibility of error.

Note that planetary such as the number of provisional planets changes over time as new discoveries are made and verified.

For information about data sources used, refer to solar_system_data.json

## Project specifications (as provided by SHU)

Create a program that displays information about planets in our solar system. For each planet your program should hold its:

* Name
* Mass
* Distance from the Sun
* A list of the planet’s moons (be sensible, don’t include all of the moons for the large planets)

All data should be held using appropriate data types. Use Wikipedia to help with values

A user should be able to query your data by asking questions such as:

* Tell me everything about Saturn?
* How massive is Neptune?
* Is Pluto in the list of planets?
* How many moons does Earth have?

You **must write a test plan that covers key parts of your solution**. You should include this as a separate file within your solution.

You should bring all of your programming knowledge to bear on this task.

You **must use classes throughout your program**.

You should include code to properly validate inputs from the user.

The raw data may be held in a file.

You may build a simple menu system.

You might create a GUI using Tkinter.

You may want to use a unit testing framework to implement some, or all, of your test plan.

Notes:

* You must the Python Programming language.
* **Do not** make a Web-based solution.
* **Do not** use a relational database.
* You will use sources such as StackOverflow discussions in building your solution. **Include references to these in comments** in your code.
